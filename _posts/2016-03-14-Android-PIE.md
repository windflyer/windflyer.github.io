After pushing some binaries onto devices that run newer versions of Android, a frustrating error often occurs:
                                           
    error: only position independent executables (PIE) are supported.

The error message is quite straightforward --- the binary is not position independent. If you have the source code, take a look at [this stack overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24818902/running-a-native-library-on-android-l-error-only-position-independent-executab) and edit your `Android.mk` accordingly. 

Things get more complicated if you only have the binary or it's not feasbile to rebuild it with PIE support. Then this post can help. I stumbled across a workaround on a Chinese website. It's very easy, even less painful than rebuilding the binary with PIE enabled.

Basically what you only need is a binary editor like [010 Editor](http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/). Use it open the binary file, count carefully to find the 17th byte, change the value *02* to *03*, and that's it!

    $ xxd gdb | head -2

    $ xxd gdb_pie | head -2
    0000000: 7f45 4c46 0101 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  .ELF............

Save your changes and the modified binary should work well on your Android device.
