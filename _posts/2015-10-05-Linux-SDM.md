After making purchase, you'll only be able to download a `.sdx` file. This file can be opened by SDM (Secure Download Manager), which is not available in Linux. Fortunately, we have an alternative: [Linux SDM Downloader](https://github.com/RadekSimkanic/Linux-SDM-Downloader). Clone Linux SDM Downloader's source code, enter its folder, and run:

	$ python main.py ms-software.sdx



You'll get a `.sdc` file and a `.sdc.key` file. Next you need another tool to decrypt the sdc file together with the key: [xSDM](https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/xSDM)

	$ xsdm ms-software.sdc

Make sure that your sdc and sdc.key are located in the same folder.
