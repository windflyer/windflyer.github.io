If you're pretty sure that you did everything right but Xposed still cannot load the class of your module, you need to check the apk file generated by Android Studio.

In my case, if my module's apk has multiple dex inside, Xposed cannot find the class. After forcing Android Studio to output an apk having only one classes.dex, it works like a charm.
