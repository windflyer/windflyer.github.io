I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, supervised by Prof. [Z. Morley Mao](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/).

I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Wuhan University and used to work at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a research assistant with Prof. [Daniel Xiapu Luo](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/).

My research interest is network and system security. The topics I'm currently working on include:

  - Android system security, vulnerability detection 
  - Cyber-physical system security
